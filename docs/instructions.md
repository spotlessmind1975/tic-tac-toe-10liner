## Game board

![gameboard](../pictures/grid.png)

This Tic-tac-toe is played on a three-by-three grid by two players, who alternately place the marks **X** and **O** in one of the nine spaces in the grid. By pressing the digit from `1` to `9`, each player will put the sign on the game board. 

The game ends what you have three signs of the same type on a vertical line, one horizontal or a diagonal. If this does not happen, you have equality, and nobody wins.

There is no universally-agreed rule as to who plays first, but in this game the convention that **O** plays first is used.
