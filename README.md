Since it joined this competition, the game itself is modest in size, and the given source code respects strong constraints on the length of each line (category: **PUR-120**) and it does not rely on third party libraries. The check has been done using [UGBASIC-IDE](https://spotlessmind1975.itch.io/ugbasic-ide).

For those wishing to deepen the details of its implementation, please refer to the following documents:
